\section{Uniform convergence and differentiation}

We have already seen, in Example \ref{myExample:7.6}, 
that uniform convergence of $\sequence{f_n}$ implies
nothing about the sequence $\sequence{f'_n}$. 
Thus stronger hypotheses are required for the assertion that 
$f'_n \rightarrow f'$ if $f_n \rightarrow f$.

\begin{thm}
    \label{thm:7.17}
    Suppose $\sequence{f_n}$ is a sequence of functions, differentiable on $[a, b]$
    and such that $\sequence{f_n(x_0)}$ converges for some point $x_0$ on $[a, b]$. 
    If $\sequence{f'_n}$ converges uniformly on $[a, b ]$, 
    then $\sequence{f_n}$ converges uniformly on $[a, b ]$, 
    to a function $f$, and
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:7.27}
        f'(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f'_n (x)
        \quad 
        (a \leq x \leq b).
    \end{equation}
\end{thm}

\begin{myRemark*}
    If the continuity of the functions $f'_n$ is assumed in addition to
    the above hypotheses, 
    then a much shorter proof of (\ref{eq:7.27}) can be based on
    Theorem \ref{thm:7.16} and the fundamental theorem of calculus.
\end{myRemark*}

\begin{thm}
    There exists a real continuous function on the real line which is
    nowhere differentiable.
\end{thm}
