\chapter{Continuity}

The function concept and some of the related terminology were introduced in
Definitions \ref{def:2.1} and \ref{def:2.2}. Although we shall (in later chapters) be mainly interested in real and complex functions (i.e., in functions whose values are real or complex numbers) we shall also discuss vector-valued functions (i.e., functions with values in $\R^{k}$) and functions with values in an arbitrary metric space. The theorems we shall discuss in this general setting would not become any easier if we restricted ourselves to real functions, for instance, and it actually simplifies and clarifies the picture to discard unnecessary hypotheses and to state and prove theorems in an appropriately general context. 

The domains of definition of our functions will also be metric spaces, suitably specialized in various instances.
