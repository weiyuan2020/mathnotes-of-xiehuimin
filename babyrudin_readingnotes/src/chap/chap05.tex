\chapter{Differentiation}

In this chapter we shall (except in the final section) confine our attention to \emph{real} functions defined on intervals or segments. 
This is not just a matter of convenience, 
since genuine differences appear when we pass from real functions to vector-valued ones. 
Differentiation of functions defined on $\R{k}$ will be discussed in Chap. 9.
