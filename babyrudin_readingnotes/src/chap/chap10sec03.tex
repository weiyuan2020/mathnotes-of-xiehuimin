\section{Partitions of unity}

\begin{thm}
    \label{thm:10.8}
    Suppose $K$ is a compact subset of $\R^n$, 
    and $\{V_{\alpha}\}$ is an open cover of $K$. 
    Then there exist functions $\psi_1, \dots, \psi_s \in \mathscr{C}(\R^n)$ 
    such that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $0 \leq \psi_i \leq 1$ for $1 \leq i \leq s$;
        \item each $\psi_i$ has its support in some $V_{\alpha}$, and
        \item $\psi_1 (\mathbf{x}) + · · · + \psi_s(\mathbf{x}) = 1$ for every $\mathbf{x} \in K$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

Because of (c), $\{\psi_i\}$ is called a partition of unity, 
and (b) is sometimes expressed by saying that $\{\psi_i\}$ is subordinate to the cover $\{V_{\alpha}\}$.

\begin{myCorollary*}
    If $f \in \mathscr{C}(\R^n)$ and the support of $f$ lies in $K$, then
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:10.25}
        f = \sum_{i=1}^{s} \psi_i f .
    \end{equation}
    Each $\psi_i f$ has its support in some $V_{\alpha}$.
\end{myCorollary*}

The point of (\ref{eq:10.25}) is that it furnishes a representation of $f$ as a sum of continuous functions $\psi_i f$ with ``small'' supports.
