\section{Continuity and connectedness}
\mybox{连续性与连通性}
\begin{thm}
    \label{thm:4.22}
    If $f$ is a continuous mapping of a metric space $X$ into a metric space $Y$, 
    and if $E$ is a connected subset of $X$, then $f(E)$ is connected.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    \label{thm:4.23}
    Let $f$ be a continuous real function on the interval $[a, b]$. 
    If $f(a) <f(b)$ and if $c$ is a number such that $f(a) < c < f(b)$, 
    then there exists a point $x \in (a, b)$ such that $f(x) = c$.
\end{thm}

\begin{myRemark}
    \label{myRemark:4.24}
    At first glance, it might seem that Theorem \ref{thm:4.23} has a converse.
    That is, one might think that if for any two points $x_1 < x_2$ 
    and for any number $c$ between $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$ 
    there is a point $x$ in $(x_1 , x_2)$ such that $f(x) = c$, 
    then $f$ must be continuous.
