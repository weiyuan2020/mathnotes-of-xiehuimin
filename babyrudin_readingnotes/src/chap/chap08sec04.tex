\section{The algebraic completeness of the complex field}
We are now in a position to give a simple proof of the fact that the complex
field is algebraically complete, 
that is to say, that every nonconstant polynomial
with complex coefficients has a complex root.

\begin{thm}
    \label{thm:8.8}
    Suppose $a_0,\dots,a_n$ are complex numbers, $n \geq 1$, $a_n \neq 0$,
    \begin{equation*}
        P(z) = \sum_{0}^{n} a_k z^k.
    \end{equation*}
    Then $P(z) = 0$  for some complex number $z$.
\end{thm}
