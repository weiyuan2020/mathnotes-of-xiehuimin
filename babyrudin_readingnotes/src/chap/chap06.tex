\chapter{The Riemann-Stieltjes integral}
\label{chap:06}

The present chapter is based on a definition of the Riemann integral 
which depends very explicitly on the order structure of the real line. 
Accordingly, 
we begin by discussing integration of real-valued functions on intervals. 
Extensions to complex- and vector-valued functions on intervals follow in later
sections. 
Integration over sets other than intervals is discussed in Chaps. 10 and 11.
