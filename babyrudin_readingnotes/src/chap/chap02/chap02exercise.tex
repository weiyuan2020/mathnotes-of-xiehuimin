\begin{myExercise}
    \label{ex:2.2}
    A complex number $z$ is said to be algebraic 
    if there are integers $a_0, ... , a_n$, not all
    zero, such that
    \begin{equation*}
        a_{0} z^{n} 
        + a_{1} z^{n-1}
        +\cdots
        + a_{n-1} z
        + a_n = 0 .
    \end{equation*}
    Prove that the set of all algebraic numbers is countable. 
    \emph{Hint}: For every positive integer $N$ 
    there are only finitely many equations with
    \begin{equation*}
        n 
        + |a_0|
