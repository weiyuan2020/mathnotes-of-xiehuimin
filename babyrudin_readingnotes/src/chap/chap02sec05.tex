\begin{myDefinition}\label{myDefinition:2.45 separated}
    % 2.45 Definition 
    Two subsets $A$ and $B$ of a metric space $X$ are said to be
    separated if both $A \cap \bar{B}$ and $\bar{A} \cap B$ are empty, i.e., if no point of $A$ lies in the
    closure of $B$ and no point of $B$ lies in the closure of $A$.
    
    A set $E \subset X$ is said to be connected if $E$ is not a union of two nonempty separated sets.
\end{myDefinition}

\begin{myRemark}\label{myRemark:2.46}
    % 2.46 Remark 
    Separated sets are of course disjoint, but disjoint sets need not
    be separated. For example, the interval $[0,1]$ and the segment $(1, 2) $ are not
    separated, since $1$ is a limit point of $(1, 2)$. However, the segments $(0, 1)$ and $(1. 2)$ are separated.
    
    The connected subsets of the line have a particularly simple structure:
\end{myRemark}

\begin{thm}
    % 2.47 Theorem 
    A subset $E$ of the real line $\mathbb{R}^1$ is connected if and only if it has the following property: If $x \in E$, $y \in E$, and $x < z <y$, then $z \in E$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    % Proof 
If there exist $x \in  E$, $y \in E$, and some $z \in (x, y)$ such that $z \not\in E$, then
$E = A_z \cup B_z$ where

\begin{equation*}
    A_z = E \cap (-\infty, z),\quad
    B_z = E \cap (z, \infty).
\end{equation*}

% BASIC TOPOLOGY 43

Since $x \in A_z$ and $y \in B_z$, $A$ and $B$ are nonempty. Since $A_z = (-\infty, z)$ and $B_z = (z, \infty)$, they are separated. Hence $E$ is not connected.

To prove the converse, suppose $E$ is not connected. Then there are
nonempty separated sets $A$ and $B$ such that $A \cup B=E$. Pick $x \in  A_z$ $y \in  B_z$
and assume (without loss of generality) that $x <y$. Define

\begin{equation*}
    z = \sup(A \cap [x, y]).
\end{equation*}

By Theorem 2.28, $z \in \bar{A}$; hence $z \not\in  B$. In particular, $x \leq z <y$.

If $z \not\in A$, it follows that $x < z < y$ and $z \not\in E$.

If $z \in  A$, then $z \not\in B$, hence there exists $z$, such that $z<z_1 <y$ and
$z_1 \not\in  B$. Then $x<z_1 <y$ and $z_1 \not\in  E$.
\end{proof}
