\chapter{The lebesgue theory}

It is the purpose of this chapter to present the fundamental concepts of the
Lebesgue theory of measure and integration and to prove some of the crucial
theorems in a rather general setting, without obscuring the main lines of the
development by a mass of comparatively trivial detail. Therefore proofs are
only sketched in some cases, and some of the easier propositions are stated
without proof. However, the reader who has become familiar with the techniques 
used in the preceding chapters will certainly find no difficulty in 
supplying the missing steps.

The theory of the Lebesgue integral can be developed in several distinct
ways. Only one of these methods will be discussed here. For alternative
procedures we refer to the more specialized treatises on integration listed in
the Bibliography.
