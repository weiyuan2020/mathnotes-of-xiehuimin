\chapter{Integration of differential forms}
\label{chap:10}

Integration can be studied on many levels. 
In Chap. 6, the theory was developed for reasonably well-behaved functions on subintervals of the real line. 
In Chap. 11 we shall encounter a very highly developed theory of integration that can be applied to much larger classes of functions, 
whose domains are more or less arbitrary sets, 
not necessarily subsets of $\R^n$. 
The present chapter is devoted to those aspects of integration theory that are closely related to the
geometry of euclidean spaces, such as the change of variables formula, line integrals, and the machinery of differential forms that is used in the statement and proof of then-dimensional analogue of the fundamental theorem of calculus, namely \myKeywordred{Stokes' theorem}.
