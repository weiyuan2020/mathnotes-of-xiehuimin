\begin{myExercise}
    \label{ex:10.1}
    Let $H$ be a compact convex set in $\R^k$, with nonempty interior. 
    Let $f \in \mathscr{C}(H)$, put $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ in the complement of $H$, 
    and define $\int_H f$ as in Definition \ref{mydef:10.3}.

    Prove that $\int_H f$ is independent of the order in which the $k$ integrations are carried out.

    \emph{Hint:} Approximate $f$ by functions that are continuous on $\R^k$ and whose supports are in $H$, as was done in Example \ref{myExample:10.47}.
