\section{Closed forms and exact forms}

\begin{mydef}
    Let $\omega$ be a $k$-form in an open set $E \subset \R^n$. 
    If there is a $(k - 1)$- form $\lambda$ in $E$ such that $\omega = \d \lambda$, then $\omega$ is said to be exact in $E$.
    
    If $\omega$ is of class $\mathscr{C}'$ and $\d \omega = 0$, 
    then $\omega$ is said to be closed.
    
    Theorem \ref{thm:10.20}(b) shows that every exact form of class $\mathscr{C}'$ is closed.

    In certain sets $E$, for example in convex ones, the converse is true; 
    this is the content of Theorem \ref{thm:10.39} 
    (usually known as Poincare's lemma) and Theorem \ref{thm:10.40}. 
    However, Examples \ref{newexample:10.36} and \ref{newexample:10.37} will exhibit closed forms that are not exact.

\begin{thm}
    \label{thm:10.38}
    Suppose $E$ is a convex open set in $\R^n$,
    $f \in \mathscr{C}'(E)$, $p$ is an integer, 
    $1 \leq p \leq n$, and
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:10.116}
        (D_j f)(\mathbf{x}) = 0
        \quad 
        (p < j \leq n, \mathbf{x} \in E).
    \end{equation}
    Then there exists an $F \in \mathscr{C}'(E)$ such that
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    \label{thm:10.39}
    If $E \in \R^n$ is convex and open, 
    if $k \geq 1$, 
    if $\omega$ is a $k$-form of class $\mathscr{C}'$ in $E$, a
    nd if $\d \omega = 0$, 
    then there is a $(k - 1)$-form $\lambda$ in $E$ 
    such that $\omega = \d \lambda$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    \label{thm:10.40}
    Fix $k$, $1 \leq k \leq n$. 
    Let $E \subset \R^n$ be an open set in which every closed $k$-form is exact. 
    Let $T$ be a 1-1 $\mathscr{C}''$-mapping of $E$ onto an open set $U \subset \R^n$ 
    whose inverse $S$ is also of class $\mathscr{C}''$.
    
    Then every closed $k$-form in $V$ is exact in $V$.
\end{thm}

Note that every convex open set $E$ satisfies the present hypothesis, by
Theorem \ref{thm:10.39}. 
The relation between $E$ and $V$ may be expressed by saying
that they are $\mathscr{C}''$-\emph{equivalent}.

\emph{Thus every closed form is exact in any set which is $\mathscr{C}''$-equivalent to a convex open set.}
