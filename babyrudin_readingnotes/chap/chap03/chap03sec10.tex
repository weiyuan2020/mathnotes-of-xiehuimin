\section{Power series}
\mybox{幂级数}
\begin{mydef}
    \label{mydef:3.38}
    Given a sequence $\sequence{c_n}$ of complex numbers, the series
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:3.19}
        \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n z^n
    \end{equation}
    is called a \emph{power series}. 
    The numbers $c_n$ are called the \emph{coefficients} of the series;
    $z$ is a complex number.
\end{mydef}

In general, the series will converge or diverge, depending on the choice of $z$.
More specifically, with every power series there is associated a circle,
the circle of convergence, such that (\ref{eq:3.19}) converges if $z$ is in the interior of the circle and 
diverges if $z$ is in the exterior (to cover all cases, we have to consider the plane as the interior of a circle of infinite radius, and a point as a circle of radius zero).
The behavior on the circle of convergence is much more varied and cannot be described so simply.

\begin{thm}
    \label{thm:3.39}
    Given the power series $\sum c_n z^n$, put
    \begin{equation*}
        \alpha = \limsup_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{|c_n|},\quad
        R = \frac{1}{\alpha}.
    \end{equation*}
    (
        If $\alpha = 0$, $R = +\infty$;
        If $\alpha = +\infty$, $R = 0$.
    ) 
    Then $\sum c_n z^n$ converges of $|z| < R$, and diverges if $|z| > R$.
\end{thm}
\mybox{$z$取值使幂级数收敛的范围称为收敛域, $R$为收敛半径. }
\begin{proof}
    Put $a_n = c_n z^n$,
    and apply the root test:
    \begin{equation*}
        \limsup_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{|a_n|}
        = |z| \limsup_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{|c_n|}
        = \frac{|z|}{R}.
    \end{equation*}
\end{proof}
Note: $R$ is called the radius of convergence of $\sum c_n z^n$.


\begin{newexample}
    \begin{asparaenum}[(a)]
    \item The series $\sum n^n z^n$ has $R = 0$.
    \item The series $\sum z^n / n!$ has $R = +\infty$.
    (In this case the ratio test is easier to apply than the root test.)
    \item The series $\sum z^n$ has $R = 1$.
    If $|z| = 1$, the series diverges, since $\sequence{z^n}$ does not tend to $0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty $.
    \item The series $\sum z^n / n$ has $R = 1$.
    It diverges if $z = 1$. It converges for all other $z$ with $|z|=1$.
    % (The last assertion will be proved in Theorem \ref{thm:3.44})
    (The last assertion will be proved in Theorem 3.44)
    \item The series $\sum z^n / n^2$ has $R = 1$.
    It converges for all $z$ with $z = 1$,
    by the comparison test, since $|z^n/n^2| = 1/n^2$.
    \end{asparaenum}
