\chapter{Sequences and series of functions}
\label{chap:07}
\mybox{函数序列与级数}

In the present chapter we confine our attention to complex-valued functions
(including the real-valued ones, of course), 
although many of the theorems and proofs 
which follow extend without difficulty to vector-valued functions, 
and even to mappings into general metric spaces. 
We choose to stay within this simple framework 
in order to focus attention on the most important aspects of
the problems that arise when limit processes are interchanged.
